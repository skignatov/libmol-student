 *** Results of Machar suborutine, from Numerical Recipes in F77 ***


ibeta - the floating-point radix                                        =                         2


it -  the number of base-ibeta digits in the floating-point mantissa    =                        53


iexp - the number of bits in the exponent (including its sign or bias). =                        11


negep - the exponent of the smallest power of ibeta that, subtracted
from 1.0, gives something different from 1.0.                           =                       -53


machep - exponent of the smallest (most negative) power of ibeta that, 
added to 1.0, gives something different from 1.0                        =                       -52


minexp - the smallest (most negative) power of ibeta consistent with
there being no leading zeros in the mantissa                            =                     -1022


maxexp - the smallest (positive) power of ibeta that causes overflow    =                      1024


eps - Smallest positive number that, added to 1.0, is not equal to 1.0  =    2.2204460492503131E-16


epsneg - Smallest positive number that, subtracted from 1.0, is not 
equal to 1.0                                                            =    1.1102230246251565E-16


xmin - Smallest representable positive number  (ibeta**minexp)          =    2.2250738585072014-308


xmax - Largest representable positive number (1-epsneg)*(ibeta**maxexp) =    1.7976931348623157+308


irnd - A code in the range 0:5, giving information on what kind of
rounding is done in addition, and on how underflow is handled.          =                         5
   irnd = 0-3 - truncating imstead of rounding (not desirable)
   irnd = 4   - rounding (IEEE not compliant)
   irnd = 5   - IEEE compliant rounding 
   irnd = 3-5 also imply the IEEE compliant underflow processing


ngrd - the number of "guard digits" used when truncating the product of
two mantissas to fit the representation                                 =                         0
